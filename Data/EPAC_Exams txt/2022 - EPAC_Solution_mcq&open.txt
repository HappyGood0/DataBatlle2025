Question 1: C 
The question was which of the following statements is not correct. Statements A, B, D are 
correct. 
Statement C is not correct because further processing can be requested later than 
19 June 2023, namely within two months of a loss-of-right communication. 
 
Legal basis 
 
Rule 126(2) EPC 
Where notification is effected by registered letter, the letter shall be deemed to be delivered to the 
addressee on the tenth day following its handover to the postal service provider unless it has failed to 
reach the addressee or has reached him at a later date. 
    
Rule 135(1) EPC 
Further processing under Article 121, paragraph 1, shall be requested by payment of the prescribed fee 
within two months of the communication concerning either the failure to observe a time limit or a loss of 
rights. The omitted act shall be completed within the period for making the request. 
  
Rule 132(2) EPC

Question 5: A 
  
Legal basis 
  
Rule 51(1) EPC 
A renewal fee for the coming year is due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the 
date of filing, i.e. on 31 August 2022. 
  
Rule 51(2) EPC 
If a renewal fee is not paid on the due date under paragraph 1, the fee may still be paid within six months 
of the said date, i.e. on 28 February 2023, provided that an additional fee is also paid within that period. 
 
Rule 51(3) EPC 
Renewal fees already due for an earlier application at the date of filing a divisional application are due on 
its filing, i.e. on 26 September 2022. These fees and any renewal fee due within four months of filing the 
divisional application may be paid within that period without an additional fee, i.e. until 26 January 2023. 
  
_______________________________________________________________________________________  
  
Question 6: D 
The invitation was received ten days after the mailing date, i.e. three days later than the seven days 
stipulated in Rule 80.6 PCT, so the period expires three days later than two months from the mailing date, 
that is, on 5 February 2023, which is a Sunday. The final date for responding is therefore 6 February 2023 
(Monday). 
 
Legal basis 
  
Rule 80.6 PCT 
[…] Irrespective of the date on which such a document or letter was mailed, if the applicant offers to the 
national Office or intergovernmental organization evidence which satisfies the national Office or 
intergovernmental organization that the document or letter was received more than seven days after the 
date it bears, the national Office or intergovernmental organization shall treat the period starting from the 
date of the document or letter as expiring later by an additional number of days which is equal to the 
number of days which the document or letter was received later than seven days after the date it bears.

Rule 80.5(i) PCT 
If the expiration of any period during which any document or fee must reach a national Office or 
intergovernmental organization falls on a day […] on which such Office or organization is not open to the 
public for the purposes of the transaction of official business […] the period shall expire on the next 
subsequent day on which [no such circumstance] exists.

Question 10: D 
  
Legal basis 
  
G 4/08 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal 
If an international patent application has been filed and published under the PCT in an official language of 
the EPO, it is not possible, on entry into the European phase, to file a translation of the application into 
another EPO official language.

Question 12: A 
  
Legal basis 
 
 
5
  
Notice from the EPO dated 21 February 2013 concerning the request for early processing, OJ EPO 3/2013, 
156 ff 
  
It depends on the date on which early processing is requested which further requirements stipulated in 
Rule 159(1) EPC must be complied with, since the (regular) time limits for paying the designation fee 
(Rule 39(1) EPC) and the renewal fee (Rule 51(1) EPC) and for filing the request for examination and paying 
the examination fee (Rule 70(1) EPC) may not have expired on the date the request for early processing is 
filed. Therefore, if any of these time limits is still running on that date, the request will be effective without 
the requirements concerned having been complied with (Article 153(2) EPC, Article 11(3) PCT). 
  
Claims fees can be paid up to expiry of the period under Rule 162(2) EPC. 
  
In the present case, the (regular) time limits for paying the designation, examination and renewal fees are 
still running.

Question 13: D 
  
Legal basis 
  
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 8.1, A-IV, 1.1.1 
Applicants may withdraw their application at any time as long as the application is pending. 
An application is pending up to (but not including) the date that the European Patent Bulletin mentions the 
grant of the patent (OJ EPO 2002, 112). 
  
_______________________________________________________________________________________  
  
Question 14: B 
  
Legal basis 
  
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 6, C-V, 10 
Errors in publication occur where the content of the printed specification differs from the documents 
(Druckexemplar) transmitted to the applicant with the communication under Rule 71(3) (Form 2004), if 
these documents form the basis of the decision to grant. The above errors in publication can be corrected 
at any time. 
  
_______________________________________________________________________________________  
  
Question 15: B 
  
Statement A is not correct because Rule 56 does not apply to missing claims (the application was filed in 
2021, i.e. before the entry into force of the new Rule 56a EPC). 
Statement B is correct (Rule 56(3) EPC). 
Statement C is not correct because it is not possible to amend the claims before search (Rule 137(1) EPC). 
Statement D is not a good solution because the date of a priority claim would precede the date of filing of 
the European patent application by more than twelve months. 
 
Legal basis 
 
 
6
  
Rule 56(1) EPC 
If the examination under Article 90, paragraph 1, reveals that parts of the description, or drawings 
referred to in the description or in the claims, appear to be missing, the European Patent Office 
shall invite the applicant to file the missing parts within two months. 
 
 
Rule 56(3) EPC 
If the missing parts of the description or missing drawings are filed […] and the application claims priority of 
an earlier application, the date of filing shall, provided that the missing parts of the description or the 
missing drawings are completely contained in the earlier application, remain the date on which the 
requirements laid down in Rule 40, paragraph 1, were fulfilled, where the applicant so requests and files, 
[…].  
  
   
Rule 137(1) EPC 
Before receiving the European search report, the applicant may not amend the description, claims or 
drawings of a European patent application unless otherwise provided.

Part 2 
Note: the legal basis and the information in parenthesis were not needed to get full marks. 
 
Question 1 
 
(a) The application EP-F3 to be transferred has to be pending at the time of transfer 
(see steps under (b)).  
File a request for a transfer of rights (EPO Form 5050 can be used) and submit 
written evidence suitable for proving the transfer (with the signature of both the 
assignor and assignee). Pay the transfer fee.  
 
(b) The filing in Italian is valid only if the previous applications were also filed in Italian. 
Request further processing by paying the fee for further processing (50% of the 
relevant fees) by 14 December 2022 and pay the search fee, filing fee (without 
reduction) according to Rule 6(4) EPC including page fee (for eight pages) and 
additional fee for divisional second generation. 
 
(c) After the transfer of rights (at the latest by the time of payment of the reduced 
examination fee) the representative of the joint applicants should send a letter to the 
EPO stating that both applicants A and C are entities or natural persons covered by 
Rule 6(4) EPC (Form 1011 can be used).  
Request examination in Italian, a translation of the request for examination in the 
language of the proceedings must be refiled (Guidelines A-X, 9.2.3). 
 
 
Question 2 
 
(a) The request for restoration had to be filed within two months of the date on which 
the priority period expired, which is 26 July 2021. 
(The priority period expired on 22 May 2021 extended to 24 May 2021.  
24 May 2021 + 2 months => 24 July 2021, extended to 26 July 2021). 
 
(b) (The restoration granted by the USPTO as receiving Office will not automatically be 
effective before the EPO because the EPO is not bound by the decision of any 
receiving Office under the "unintentional criterion".)  
To ensure that priority is restored during the European phase, the applicant should 
request restoration of priority within one month of the date on which the time limit for 
entry into EPO regional phase expires (Article 22 PCT) 
(Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT; Rule 159(1)) EPC sets a 31-month deadline) 
22.05.2020 + 31 months = 22.12.2022  
22.12.2022 + 1 month = 22.01.2023 (Sunday) extended to 23.01.2023 
(Monday).  
 
 
 
8
The fee for restoration of priority must be paid within the same time limit 
(Rule 49ter.2(b)(iii), (d) PCT).  
The request for restoration of priority must be accompanied by a statement of reasons 
for the failure, despite meeting the due-care requirement, to file the international 
application within the priority period (Rule 49ter.2(b)(ii) PCT). 
 
Question 3 
 
(a) Confirm to the receiving Office (International Bureau) that the drawings of the 
priority application are included in the international patent application through 
incorporation by reference (Rule 20(6) PCT). 
Send a copy of these drawings to the receiving Office (International Bureau) 
together with the confirmation.  
Within two months of the original filing date  
5 December 2022 + 2 months => 5 February 2023 (Sunday) => extended to 
6 February. 
 
(b) Same as (a) / (Confirm to the International Bureau that the drawings of the priority 
application are included in the international patent application through incorporation 
by reference, send a copy of these drawings to the International Bureau together 
with the confirmation).  
 
RO/107 notification bears a two-month time limit, 
4 January 2023 + 2 months => 4 March 2023 (Saturday) => extended to 6 March 
2023 
 
(c) The requirement for incorporation by reference is that the priority of the earlier 
application must also have been claimed on filing (Rule 20(6) PCT). 
Thus, no remedy is possible in this case. 
 
(d) Yes, you can withdraw the application and prevent publication before completion of 
technical preparations for the publication. 
Publication is due promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, 
which is after 20 June 2023 (in practice Thursday, 22 June). 
The technical preparations for publication are completed by the 15th day prior to the 
date of publication (see paragraph AG 9.014; in practice, withdrawal at the latest on 
Tuesday, 6 June). 
 
Question 4 
 
(a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by 
12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). 
 
 
9
The filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of 
abstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) 
EPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). 
 
(b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was 
duly replenished (point 8 AAD).  
Since this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be 
withdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). 
No action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account 
(the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the 
filing fee (which includes the page fee)).  
 
(c) A translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application 
12 Dec 2022 + 2 months = 12 Feb 2023 (Sun) = 13 Feb 2023; 
or within two months of notification of a communication under Rule 58 EPC.  
 
If documents to be filed by one of the means of electronic communication permitted 
by the President of the European Patent Office (under Rule 2(1) EPC) cannot be 
received on the day on which a period for performing procedural acts expires, the 
period shall extend to the first working day on which all means of electronic filing are 
available (Rule 134(1) EPC and OJ EPO 2020, A120). 
 
Question 5 
 
A divisional application can only be filed if the parent application is still pending. 
Currently, EP-A1 is deemed to be withdrawn because no response to the 
communication under Article 94(3) EPC was filed. The time limit for filing a response 
expired on 28 November 2022 (26 Saturday > Monday 28). 
In order to revert application EP-A1 to pending status, the applicant must request 
further processing by paying the further processing fee and file a response to the 
communication under Article 94(3) EPC. 
 
The filing fee and search fee for EP-A2 are due on filing. They may be paid within one 
month of the date of filing of the divisional application (Rule 36(3) EPC). 
The third renewal fee and the fourth renewal fee for the divisional become due on filing. 
They can be validly paid without surcharge within four months of the date of filing of the 
divisional application (Rule 51(3) EPC) (otherwise with surcharge within six months of 
the same date). 
 
The applicant should file claims directed to invention Y (Rule 40(1) EPC) in response to 
a communication from the EPO (under Rule 58 EPC setting a time limit of two months 
from the date of receipt to supply claims) at the latest.
